# Razzle âœ¨

A zero-config, razzle-dazzle build system for universal JavaScript applications.

## Motivation

Universal JavaScript applications are tough to setup. Getting your build system just right can take days or maybe even weeks. Razzle aims to fill this void by giving you a universal build system out of the box and then gets out of hell out of your way. Redux? Mobx? Styled Components? CSS? Flow? Preact? Go knock yourself out. Razzle doesn't care. It will hot reload pretty much anything you can throw at it.

## Features

- Like Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), but for universal apps.
- Uses Webpack Hot Module Replacement on both the client and server. You type, and Razzle will take care of the rest.
- Comes with your favorite ES6 JavaScript goodies, `babel-preset-razzle`...(hey that rhymes!)
- Agnostic about data fetching and routing.
- Agnostic about CSS-in-JS or styling.
- Works with React, [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs), [Rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax), Vue, and Angular 2.
- Next.js-like customization API via `razzle.config.js`.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ yarn global add razzle

razzle init myApp
cd myApp
yarn start
```

## 25 seconds to bootstrap

## Customization

### Extending Babel Config

Razzle comes with most of ES6 stuff you need. However, if you want to add your own babel transformations, just add a `.babelrc` file to the root of your project. 

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "razzle/babel",
    "stage-0"
   ]
}
```

### Extending Webpack

You can also extend the underlying webpack config. Create a file called `razzle.config.js` in your project's root. 

```js
// razzle.config.js

module.exports = {
  modify: (config, {target, dev}, webpack) => {
    // do something to config
  
    return config
  }
}
```

### Webpack Flags

- `process.env.RAZZLE_PUBLIC_DIR`: Path to the public directory.
- `process.env.RAZZLE_ASSETS_MANIFEST`: Path to a file containing compiled asset outputs
- `process.env.PORT`: default is `3000`, unless changed
- `process.env.NODE_ENV`: `'development'` or `'production'`
- `process.env.BUILD_TARGET`: either `'client'` or `'server'`


## Razzle API Reference

### `razzle init <project>` 
This will create a new razzle project (with the global CLI) installed. It will also install dependencies.

### `razzle start` 

This run the project in development mode.   
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `razzle build`
Builds project for production. Final build located in `build` directory.   
You can run your app by simply running:   

```
node build/server.js
```

or  

```
yarn run start:prod
```

### `razzle.config.js`

There are just a few settings you should know about. 

```js
// razzle.config.js

module.exports = {
  port: 3000, // Changes default port setting
  host: '0.0.0.0', // Changes default host, useful for testing on mobile
  clearConsole: false, // Show verbose output, will not clear console on changes.
  modify: (config, { target, dev }, webpack) => {
    // do something and return config
  
    return config
  }
}
```
