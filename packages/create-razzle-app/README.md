# Create Razzle App

Create UNIVERSAL React, Preact, and Inferno apps in one command.

```
npm i -g create-razzle-app
create-razzle-app my-proj
cd my-proj
npm start
```

or.... with the `yarn create` command:

```
yarn create razzle-app my-proj
cd my-proj
yarn start
```

You can also initialize a project from one of the examples.

cd my-preact-app
npm start
```
