## Idea behind the example
This sample has the full SSR setup as described in the [react-loadable docs](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable#--------------server-side-rendering).
It demonstrates simple dynamic imports using [react-loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable) on top of SSR with razzle.
