## Idea behind the example
This is an example of how to use [Razzle](https://razzlejs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

Basic Razzle uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transform TypeScript to plain JavaScript ( with [babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader) ), and uses TypeScript for type-checking.

Razzle knows how to resolve `.ts` and `.tsx` files out-of-box.
