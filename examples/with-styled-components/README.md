# Razzle with-styled-components Example

## Idea behind the example
This is a basic, bare-bones example that shows a very minimal implementation
of [StyledComponents](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).
It satisfies the entry points `src/index.js` for the server and`src/client.js`
for the browser.
There are comments in `src/server.js` to show how the styles are gathered and
rendered into to the DOM
