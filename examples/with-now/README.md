### Setup Now:

[Now](https://zeit.co/now) manages app deployments with a [desktop](https://zeit.co/download) app or [CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli).

* You can download either the [desktop](https://zeit.co/download) (ships and installs the CLI as well) or just the [CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli)
  * Or install only the CLI directly using: `npm install -g now`
* Create a Now [account](https://zeit.co/signup)
* Authenticate in the desktop app or CLI with `now login`

### Deploy:

* Deploy using `now` in the root of your app.
* Open your [Dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard/deployments) and test your deployment
  * Note: on the free plan your deployment and logs will be **_publicly visible_**

#### Additional Configuration:

* Additional build, deployment, and config steps available: [Zeit/Now](https://zeit.co/now#frequently-asked-questions)
