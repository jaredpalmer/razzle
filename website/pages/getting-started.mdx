# Getting Started

## Quick Start

```sh
npx create-razzle-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app. Your console should look like this:

  width="500px"
  alt="Razzle Development Mode"
/>

**That's it**. You don't need to worry about setting up multiple webpack configs or other build tools. Just start editing `src/App.js` and go!

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

## Commands

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### npm start

Runs the project in development mode.  
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### npm run start:prod

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### npm test

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### rs

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.

## Debugging with Inspector

- `npm start -- --inspect=[host:port]` This will start the node server and enable the inspector agent. The `=[host:port]` is optional and defaults to `=127.0.0.1:9229`. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

- `npm start -- --inspect-brk=[host:port]` This is the same as `--inspect`, but will also break before user code starts. (to give a debugger time to attach before early code runs) For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).
