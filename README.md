# React Production Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpalmer/react-production-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpalmer/react-production-starter)

An example react application (master-detail feed) with isomorphic rendering, async react-router routes, async redux reducers, async data fetching, and code-splitting.

#### Motivation
The file size of isomorphic React apps can quickly get out of hand. Many isomorphic starter kits look awesome to begin with but yield a several megabyte javascript file for the client to download. This project aims to demonstrate some possible solutions.

#### Under the Hood
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
 - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
 - [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) 2.0
 - [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) for CSS by Khan Academy
 - [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for meta tags by the NFL
 - [Redial](https://github.com/markdalgleish/redial) for data fetching by [@markdalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish)
 - [Babel 6](https://github.com/babel/babel)
 - [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) with Hot Module Replacement
