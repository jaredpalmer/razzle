# React Production Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpalmer/react-production-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpalmer/react-production-starter)

An example react application (master-detail feed) with isomorphic rendering, async react-router routes, async redux reducers, async data fetching, and code-splitting.

#### Motivation
The file size of isomorphic React apps can quickly get out of hand. Many isomorphic starter kits look awesome to begin with but yield a several megabyte javascript file for the client to download. This project aims to demonstrate some possible solutions.
