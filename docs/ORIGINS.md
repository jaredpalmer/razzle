The primary code for these docs was forked from Flatdoc. All code forked from Flatdoc is under Flatdoc's original license.

Inside of nested directories inside this `docs` directory, are copies of other
projects needed to build the documentation, which are being released under
their original licenses, and their original licenses are included along with their
original (or potentially modified) source code.

Some included fonts in the documentation are released under their own original
licenses, and we have included the licenses for those fonts in the directories
closest to the font files.

The syntax highlighting portion of the documentation uses `highlightJs` which
is included in this repo, along with its original license under
`docs/highlightJs`.
