Editing Content & Style:
----------------

**There's no build step needed**. Open the corresponding `.html` file (e.g. `index.html`) and make the changes to the markdown embedded in the `<head>`. Refresh the page and your changes will be rendered.

`flatdoc.js` is the script that turns our inline markdown into html. `theme-white/script.js` attaches some scrolling logic. `theme-white/style.css` is our syles.
